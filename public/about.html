<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>Profile Overview:</h2>

<p>I am a dedicated and ambitious student currently pursuing a Bachelor of Engineering (B.E.) in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) with a specialization in the Internet of Things (IoT) at Sri Sairam Engineering College, Chennai. As I enter my third year of study, I have consistently demonstrated a strong aptitude for learning and applying new technologies. My academic journey, coupled with hands-on project experiences, has equipped me with a robust skill set in coding, IoT, AI, and web development.</p>

<h2>Educational Background:</h2>

<p>My educational journey began at Vyasa Vidyalaya Matriculation Higher Secondary School, Chennai, where I completed my 10th standard with a commendable percentage of 88%. I continued my academic pursuits at the same institution, completing my 12th standard with an outstanding percentage of 91%. These formative years laid a strong foundation for my analytical and problem-solving skills, which I further honed during my undergraduate studies at Sri Sairam Engineering College. Currently, I maintain a GPA of 8.042 in my B.E. program, reflecting my commitment to academic excellence.</p>

<h2>Technical Skills:</h2>

<p>Throughout my academic journey, I have developed proficiency in several programming languages, including C, Python, Java, and Arduino. My skills extend to IoT, where I have gained hands-on experience in integrating various sensors and utilizing microcontrollers like Arduino and NodeMCU. I have also ventured into AI, handling basic implementations, and UI/UX design, particularly using Canva. Additionally, I am currently focused on web development, enhancing my skills in both front-end and back-end development.</p>

<h2>Project Experience:</h2>

<p>One of my significant projects, "Smart Forest Management," involved developing an IoT-based system to detect and prevent forest fires and theft. In this project, I integrated sensors such as humidity, temperature, and pressure with Arduino and NodeMCU. Using OpenCV, I implemented human activity detection to enhance security measures. The data collected by these sensors was sent to ThingSpeak via NodeMCU's WiFi module, enabling forest workers to manage the forest more efficiently. This project allowed me to apply my technical skills in a real-world context, enhancing my understanding of IoT and data integration.

Another notable project is the "Smart Asset Locator," an IoT-based solution for efficient object tracking and retrieval. My role in this project involved integrating RFID technology. The system used RFID tags attached to valuables and a centralized RFID receiver to track objects within designated areas. The mobile app provided real-time feedback and sound alerts, making it easier for users to locate their items. This project further enhanced my skills in RFID integration and IoT.</p>
